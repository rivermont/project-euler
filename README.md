# project-euler
This is a storage space for organizing my solutions to the Project Euler problems.<br>
If you do not wish to have solutions spoiled, you should probably turn around and go home.<br>
If you came here looking for solutions, take a minute to think about what you're doing, then **do them yourself please**!

# Questions
I understand that Project Euler do not like it when solutions are shared, however that is not my intent.<br>
I created this repo to store my own code, not to share it with people looking for solutions (hence the warning at the top).<br>
